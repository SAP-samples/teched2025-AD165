# Exercise 1 - Build your Center of Excellence workspace

In this exercise, we will create a public workspace from a template that you first upload to your SAP Build Work Zone tenant. As you will be working in a shared environment, it is important that you give all objects you create easily identifiable names, e.g. containing your 3-digit user ID which you can also find on your desktop.


## Exercise 1.1 Open the SAP Build Lobby and navigate to SAP Build Work Zone

1. To launch SAP Build Work Zone, go to the [Build Lobby](https://ad165-m3ep4xn0.eu10.build.cloud.sap/lobby) and login with the user that is available on your desk and password **Acce$$teched25**.
